The purpose of the following code is to examine the distribution of the difference in projected PPR fantasy points and actual PPR fantasy points 
(projected PPR points - actual PPR points) from the 2019 NFL season, for all positions collectively (QB, RB, WR, TE). Based on the two plots that resulted, it can be seen that the difference in proj - actual PPR points, for both fanatsy points per game and total fantasy points across the season, produce relatively normal distributions. While this is what was expected, it is nice to see that the distributions aren't multimodal or heavily skewed.
